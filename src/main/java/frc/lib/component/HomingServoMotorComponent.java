/**
 * A servo motor component with automatic homing functionality.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This component extends {@link ServoMotorComponent} to add automatic homing
 * capabilities.
 * Homing is the process of moving a mechanism to a known physical hard stop and
 * resetting
 * the encoder position, ensuring accurate absolute positioning throughout
 * operation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The homing sequence is triggered automatically when:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The mechanism needs homing (after moving away from home)</li>
 * <li>A setpoint targets the home position</li>
 * <li>The mechanism is near the home position</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * During homing, the component:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Disables soft limits to allow movement to the hard stop</li>
 * <li>Applies a constant voltage towards the hard stop</li>
 * <li>Monitors velocity to detect when the mechanism has stopped</li>
 * <li>Resets the encoder position once stopped</li>
 * <li>Re-enables soft limits and applies position control</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * @param <M> the type of MotorIO implementation used by this component
 * @see ServoMotorComponent
 * @see HomingConfig
